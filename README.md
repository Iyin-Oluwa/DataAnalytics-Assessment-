# Data Analytics SQL Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains the SQL queries addressing four data analytics questions, focusing on customer savings and investment behavior, transaction frequency, account inactivity, and customer lifetime value (CLV) estimation.

## Question 1: Customers with Both Savings and Investments
Approach:
- Joined the `users_customuser` table with `plans_plan` and `savings_savingsaccount`.  
- Filtered active plans (`status_id = 2`).  
- Summed flags for savings and investments to identify customers with both.  
- Calculated total deposits by summing `confirmed_amount` from transactions, converted from minor units.  
- Grouped by user and ordered by total deposits descending.

## Question 2: Customer Transaction Frequency Categories
Approach:  
- Calculated monthly transaction counts per customer.  
- Averaged monthly transaction counts to determine transaction frequency per month.  
- Categorized customers into 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low' frequency based on average transactions per month.  
- Aggregated counts and average transaction rates per category.

## Question 3: Account Inactivity Alert
Approach:  
- Focused on active plans (`status_id = 1`).  
- Considered inflow transactions only (`transaction_type_id IN (1, 2)` â€” IDs to be confirmed).  
- Found last transaction date per plan and owner.  
- Calculated inactivity in days since last transaction.  
- Flagged accounts with inactivity greater than 365 days.  
- Identified plan type using flags `is_regular_savings` and `is_fixed_investment`.

## Question 4: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation
Approach:  
- Calculated tenure in months from user's join date to current date.  
- Counted total transactions and average transaction amount.  
- Applied simplified CLV formula:  
  `(monthly_txn_rate * 12 months) * (0.001 * avg_amount)`
- Profit per transaction assumed as 0.1% of transaction amount.  
- Sorted results by estimated CLV descending.

## Challenges and Resolution

1. Understanding the Data Relationships  
   It took some time to understand how the tables were connected. I resolved this by reviewing column names and testing join conditions with sample queries.

2. Calculating Frequency Accurately  
   Some customers had transactions in only a few months, which could make their average look too low. To fix this, I calculated average transactions based only on months with activity. This gave a fairer view of how often each customer actually transacts.

3. Frequency Classification Logic 
   Classifying transaction frequency by monthly averages required nested subqueries and careful grouping. I broke it down into intermediate steps for better clarity and performance.

4. Inactive Plans Filter 
   Identifying truly inactive plans meant isolating only inflow transactions. I ensured the `transaction_type_id` filter was accurate and used `MAX()` to find the most recent transaction.
